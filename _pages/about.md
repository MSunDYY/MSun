As the most of energetic boys,I'm not that outgoing,but I have full enthusiasm in what I love.
I'm fond of thinking independently as well as communicating with others.I enjoy the process of researching 
and solving problems.

I'm positive and optimistic to face challenges in the life.I admire successful people and I learn from excellent people
around me all the time.

I love sports such as ping-pong and running.When stressful,I'm accustomed to running on the playground to relex myself.
